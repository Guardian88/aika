A good starting point to get familiar with this project are probably the following three test cases:
- SimplePatternMatchingTest (Demonstrates how a pattern like a word or a phrase can be matched)
- MutualExclusionTest (Demonstrates a negative feed back loop)
- NamedEntityRecognitionTest (A more complex example: recognize the name jackson cook)
- SuspensionTest (Demonstrates how neurons and logic nodes can be suspended to an external storage)
