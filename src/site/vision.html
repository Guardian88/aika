			<h1>Future Developments</h1>
			<p>
				<h2>Aika as a programming language for NLP tasks</h2>
				<p>
					Aika is a very general algorithm that can be applied to all kinds of natural language processing related tasks.
					All that has to be done is to formulate a given task as network of neurons and synapses. At first this might
					not sound like an programming task, but it works pretty well to model linguistic concepts as neurons. Unlike
					conventional neural networks, synapses in Aika allow to manipulate the text range and the word positions of
					the neuron activations. This allows for a great deal of freedom.
					<br/>
					So one goal of the Aika project is to set up a library of predefined networks that can be applied to linguistic
					problems out of the box. Tasks that could be tackled are <a href="https://github.com/aika-algorithm/aika-networks/issues/1">syntax parsing</a>, language detection, sentence splitting, coreference resolution
					or word sense disambiguation.
                    <br/>
                    These networks should, however, share a common set of entity neurons representing the concrete meaning of a word
                    or phrase. Based on these entities other properties like the word type, the language and the category (e.g. city name, person name, profession) can be deduced.
				</p>
				<h2>Aika as a self learning system</h2>
				<p>
					Currently, Aika has only rudimentary support for automated training. Aika's architecture, however, is well
					suited as a foundation for a self learning system. Since Aika is based on an artificial neural network, it
					should be easy to use the usual training methods for training a neural network such as back propagation.
					<br/>
					But there are also other
					ways that Aika could be trained with as well. Since Aika selects one interpretation of a text and suppresses all
					others, we have an easy way of generating our supervised training data by labeling the suppressed options as negative examples.
					<br/>
					Another training mechanism that
					could be implemented is to use Aikas Frequent Pattern Lattice to search for statistically significant
					patterns and generate new neurons based on them. This would be an unsupervised training method that could be used to
					find syllables, words, commonly used phrases or other kinds of patterns in a text.
					<br/>
					It should also
					be possible to apply <a href="http://adios.tau.ac.il/algorithm.html">grammar induction</a> methods. For instance if there are several significant patterns
					in the pattern lattice that share a common unsignificant parent pattern, then a new neuron could be
					introduced that consists of a disjunction of the original patterns. This way not only conjunctions like patterns could be
					trained but also disjunctions.
				</p>
				<h2>Further optimizations to the Aika core algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					Aika is already a highly optimized algorithm, but nevertheless there are surely ways to further improve it.
					For instance, Aika currently uses an optimization that cuts branches from the search tree that is used to find the best interpretation.
					This optimization, however, seems to remove valid search options when applied to positive feedback loops. This still needs to be fixed.
